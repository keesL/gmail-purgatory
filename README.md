# gmail-purgatory
A project that will access the Inbox of a user and move all messages not explicitly addressed to them into purgatory. Not for the faint of heart. Requires messing with Google APIs, OAUTH creds, etc.

To get started, first follow the instructions at (https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python). 
Without the `credentials.json` file, this will not work.
